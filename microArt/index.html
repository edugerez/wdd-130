     When we hear the word "art", great sculptures, paintings by famous 
     artists, and many times even works of art that we cannot understand 
     or find their essence or meaning come to mind. <br><br>Seems much of 
     art is reserved only for those who studied art and can understand 
     what the artist wants to convey, the microscopic works of Polo 
     Jerez can be understood, appreciated, and enjoyed with the naked 
     eye and at first contact. <br><br>Well, not so naked eye! They 
     are so small that they can only be seen clearly through powerful 
     magnifying glasses focusing on the work. <br><br>It is not necessary 
     to understand art to enjoy and be amazed by the works, but it is a
     bit hard to believe and many people come to wonder if it is not some 
     optical illusion or trick.<br><br>For that same reason is why the works
     are presented in transparent capsules where you can glimpse a little with
     the naked eye to be able to compare and verify that the works are really there.
