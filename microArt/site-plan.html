      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Think of the great artworks that have been made in history and what makes them unique.
        My website aims to present great works of art with the singularity of being the smallest ever created in the world; in fact, they are so small that if we don't see them we don't believe it. The Webpage presents the artist (“Polo Jerez”), the technique, the tools, videos and his works of art made with his own hands and a possible schedule of exhibitions. Can you imagine a picture painted in a single grain of sugar? Possible? You have to see it!
        The astonishment, the interesting and the unique is guaranteed!

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The page seeks to reach influencers and businessmen or people with influences who may have a fairly broad idea of the works and thus close purchase agreements, exhibitions, or similar events.
        On the other hand,  is not aimed at a professional audience of art critics, but rather tries to reach an audience that does not necessarily have to understand art but knows how to value when there is talent in realizing artwork and achieving admiration for it, so the general public, ages can range from children moved by curiosity and wonder, to adults who can enjoy something interesting and amazing.

        <h3>About MicroArt</h3>
        <p>When we hear the word "art", great sculptures, paintings by famous artists, and many times even works of art that we cannot understand or find their essence or meaning come to mind. Because much of art is reserved only for those who studied art and can understand what the artist wants to convey, the microscopic works of Polo Jerez can be understood, appreciated, and enjoyed with the naked eye and at first contact. Well, not so naked eye! They are so small that they can only be seen clearly through powerful magnifying glasses focusing on the work. It is not necessary to understand art to enjoy and be amazed by the works, but it is a bit hard to believe and many people come to wonder if it is not some optical illusion, trick or something like that and that is why they are presented in transparent capsules where you can glimpse a little with the naked eye to be able to compare and verify that the works are really there, made by a great talent and a great idea. <hr>

      <h3>The Artist</h3>
       <p>Polo Jerez is one of the only artists in the world capable of creating works of art of extremely small size. With his own technique, his works themselves are an innovation in fine art. He performs the works only with his own hands and with the help of a powerful binocular loupe (something very similar to a microscope). Thanks to an incredible pulse, concentration and talent, he can create works on different surfaces and materials such as grains of sugar, grains of rice, pin heads, hand hair, hair, and even eyelashes where he writes and draws. His works then are varied and the collections can include paintings on sugar crystals, carvings on grains of rice (“The manger”), sculptures on pin heads, inside the eye of small needles and even sculptures of camels walking on hairs. The collections are not limited only to paintings, but also apply carving and sculpture, which are other artistic disciplines with which the artist enjoys creating in the microscopic world. And as if all this were not enough, among the collections the artist has managed to innovate and create amazing works where the public can interact with them; as is the case with one of his works where visitors can turn on the light inside a picturesque little house built on the head of a small pin. In this particular work, the lighting engineers still don't understand how he managed to fit light into something so small.
        Since his childhood, Polo Jerez has been drawn to the idea of smallness and the challenge of creating very tiny art. Although the artist can draw and paint, even larger works and artistic carvings, it is his passion for the small that has taken him a lifetime to perfect his technique, doing a lot of research and trying many times until he feels comfortable working into a microscopic scale.
          <hr>“Most choose a conventional art, but I wanted to do something unique and different, something very small and big at the same time”

        <h3>How He do it</h3>
         <p>Part of his secret is to get into a lot of concentration, lower his heart rate and breathing to the minimum possible level to the point of practically not moving, and finally, work between heartbeats since it is the only vibration impossible to avoid in the pulse of the hand.
          The technique that he uses is unique since it is simply a talent developed with a lot of practice and a lot of patience. In fact, tools such as cutters, paints, sculpting materials or tweezers are all created by the artist and in many cases for each new idea, the artist must investigate, try different materials, create new tools, and discover new things in each new project. Polo Jerez has come to understand that in such a tiny world, materials behave differently and every little detail is a very small detail. a little sigh and the work can disappear in from the artist's eyes!
          Among the limited exhibitions that have been made of the collections, the impact generated in the visitors is always amazement and the repeated phrase among them: "I have seen something unique, and incredible that I will never forget"<hr>
