        <p>Part of his secret is to get into a lot of concentration, 
          lower his heart rate and breathing to the minimum possible 
          level to the point of practically not moving, and finally, 
          work between heartbeats, since it is the only vibration 
          impossible to avoid in the pulse of the hand. <br><br> The technique
          that he uses is unique, it is simply a talent
          developed with a lot of practice and a lot of patience. <br><br>
          In fact, tools such as cutters, paints, sculpting 
          materials or tweezers are all created by the artist and 
          in many cases for each new idea, the artist must
          investigate, try different materials, create new tools,
          discovering new things in each new project.

            <p> The small works often made on pinheads and even 
                written tabs are so small that any sudden movement or
                strong breath can ruin the work, break it or disappear,
                so the artist's concentration is one of the most 
                necessary tools to work.

            <p> Polo Jerez has come to understand that in such a tiny 
                world, materials behave differently and every little
                detail is a very small detail. <br><br> A little sigh and the
                work can disappear in from the artist's eyes! <br><br>
                Among the limited exhibitions that have been made of the
                collections, the impact generated in the visitors 
                is always amazement and the repeated phrase among 
                them: <br><br> "I have seen something unique, and incredible 
                that I will never forget"

                     Polo Jerez has challenged itself to maintain an
                     average size per work or parts of them of one
                     square millimeter or less.

                Experience has shown us that it is very difficult for 
                people to understand what the works are about, since
                they have generally never seen anything similar.
