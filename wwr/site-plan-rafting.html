    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The website wants to reach both young and family audiences, seeking to provide a fun moment as part of anti-stress therapy.<hr>
         At the same time, it seeks to capture an audience willing to pay competitive rates in order to guarantee a complete service.<hr>
          The audience will access the site through desktop and mobile devices but not through an application.<hr>
        Attempts are made to attract potential clients by focusing marketing on searches for fun, vacations, anti-stress therapies, and searches for places near the location of the service.</p>
